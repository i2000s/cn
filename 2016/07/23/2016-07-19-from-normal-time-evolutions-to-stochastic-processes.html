<p>In the JuliaQuantum’s <a href="https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/QuBase.jl">Base.jl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/QuDynamics.jl">QuDynamics.jl</a> projects, intensive efforts have been focusing on the time evolution of quantum systems and the idea of propagator has been framed out. To reach out the regime of more complicated scenarios to simulate general quantum systems, however, it may be better to reframe things immediately on top of operators and superoperators language in my opinion. Operators may be familiar to most of the readers, and superoperators are just another layer of operations on operators. Superoperator notations have been widely used to describe the evolution of open quantum systems where the concept of propagator can be fully characterized. In the mean time, quantum measurement and control usually involve stochastic processes instead of differentiable deterministic time-evolution processes. There, propagators are not the minimal building blocks any more, but operator and superoperator language still valid to define the dynamics of the quantum system.</p>
<h2 id="a-normal-time-evolution-instance">A normal time-evolution instance</h2>
For a simple example, a quantum measurement on an atomic ensemble through a magnetic field or ideal single photon sources may be described by the following differential map
\begin{equation}\label{eq:drhot}
\hat{\rho}(t+dt) = \hat{M}_0(dt)\hat{\rho}(t)\hat{M}^\dagger_0(dt) +
\sum_{\mu&gt;0} \hat{M}_\mu (dt)\hat{\rho}(t)\hat{M}^\dagger(dt)
\end{equation}
where the self-evolution operator in the time slot <span class="math inline">\(dt\)</span> is given by <span class="math inline">\(\hat{M}_0(dt)=\hat{\mathbb{1}}-\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}_{eff}dt\)</span> with the effective Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{eff}=\hat{H}-\frac{i\hbar}{2}\sum_\mu \hat{L}_\mu^\dagger \hat{L}_\mu\)</span>. The system Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span> can be arbitrary yet Hermitian. It defines how the system processes without interacting with environment and its energy spectrum (levels). If we consider a spin-<span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> system in the z-basis, a simple free-processing Hamiltonian could be
\begin{align}
\hat{H} &amp;= \left( \matrix{E_+ &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; E_-}\right),
\end{align}
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(E_+\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_-\)</span> are the two energy levels. Obviously, it can be rewritten using the Pauli operators.</p>
The so-called jump operators <span class="math inline">\(\hat{L}_\mu\)</span> define how the system will evolve in each measurement basis <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. A quantum state will be evolved into
\begin{align}
\ket{\Psi(t+dt)} &amp;= \hat{L}_\mu(dt) \ket{\Psi(t)}
\end{align}
<p>if only considering the single jump operator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{L}_\mu\)</span> applied in a small period of time, <span class="math inline">\(dt\)</span>. We call <span class="math inline">\(\hat{L}_\mu\)</span> a jump operator because it projects the quantum state towards some eigenstate of the operator randomly. For example, we could let $ \hat{L}_i = \sigma_z $ for a spin-<span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> system, which means <span class="math inline">\(\hat{L}_i\)</span> will tend to project the system onto one of its eigenstate for spin number <span class="math inline">\(\pm \frac{1}{2}\)</span> in the z-basis. To give a concrete sense of physics, this type of jump operators could corresponding to a magnetic field interaction–the one as we know in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment">Stern-Gerlach experiment</a>.</p>
We can formally define a set of Krause operators
\begin{align}
\hat{M}_\mu &amp;= \hat{L}_\mu \sqrt{dt},\quad \mu=1,\cdots,m.
\end{align}
Notice that each <span class="math inline">\(\hat{M}_\mu\)</span> is on the order of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{dt}\)</span> which makes the Krause operator a second-order effect on the evolution of the system. We define the Krause operators in this way is based on the fact that the measurement operators <span class="math inline">\(\hat{E}_\mu\)</span> and the probability of finding the output on the <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> channel <span class="math inline">\(p_\mu\)</span> should be
\begin{align}
\hat{E}_\mu &amp;= \hat{M}^\dagger_\mu\hat{M}_\mu \\
p_\mu &amp;= \tr\left( \hat{\rho}\hat{E}_\mu\right) \label{eq:jumppmu}
\end{align}
which are incremental over <span class="math inline">\(dt\)</span> time slots. The post-measurement state can therefore be written as
\begin{align}\label{eq:rhodt}
\hat{\rho}_\mu = \frac{\hat{M}_\mu\hat{\rho}\hat{M}^\dagger_\mu}{p_\mu}.
\end{align}
For a pure state <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\rho}=\ketbra{\Psi}{\Psi}\)</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>,
\begin{align} \label{eq:Psidt}
\ket{\Psi(t+dt)}_\mu = \frac{\hat{M}_\mu\ket{\Psi(t)}}{\sqrt{p_\mu}} = \frac{\hat{L}_\mu\ket{\Psi(t)}}{ \abs{\hat{L}_\mu\ket{\Psi(t)}} }.
\end{align}
<p>Eq.<span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:Psidt}\)</span> may look more familiar than Eq.<span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:rhodt}\)</span> as the former one is commonly used to describe Born’s rules on quantum measurements.</p>
<p>If we look at Eqs.<span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:Psidt}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:rhodt}\)</span> more closely, we will find that both has been used in defining the algorithms of <strong><em>quantum diffusion Monte Carlo</em></strong> (QDMC) or <strong><em>quantum wavefunction Monte Carlo</em></strong> (QWFMC) method<a href="#Dum1992Monte"> [1,2,3,4]</a>. The <span class="math inline">\(\hat{L}_\mu\)</span> operator indeed defines the random quantum jumps in the algorithm with a jump probability defined in Eq.<span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:jumppmu}\)</span>! Each jump will lead to a new quantum trajectory and <em>diffuse</em> the quantum states over time.</p>
Further more, if we rewrite Eq.<span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:drhot}\)</span> in the form of an ordinary differential equation, we have obtain
\begin{align} \label{eq:lindblad}
\dd{\rho}{t} &amp;= -\frac{i}{\hbar} \left[ \hat{H},\hat{\rho}\right]-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\mu=1}^m \left( \hat{L}_\mu^\dagger\hat{L}_\mu\hat{\rho}+\hat{\rho}\hat{L}^\dagger_\mu\hat{L}_\mu-2\hat{L}_\mu\hat{\rho}\hat{L}^\dagger_\mu \right).
\end{align}
This is the famous <em>Lindblad</em> form of the <strong><em>quantum master equation</em></strong> for an open system! In many textbooks, the Lindblad equation can also be formally simplified by defining a superoperator <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}[\cdot]\)</span> via
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D}[\hat{\rho}] = -\frac{i}{\hbar} \left[ \hat{H},\hat{\rho}\right]-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\mu=1}^m \left( \hat{L}_\mu^\dagger\hat{L}_\mu\hat{\rho}+\hat{\rho}\hat{L}^\dagger_\mu\hat{L}_\mu-2\hat{L}_\mu\hat{\rho}\hat{L}^\dagger_\mu \right)
\end{equation}
<p>so that <span class="math inline">\(\dd{\hat{\rho}}{t}=\mathcal{D}[\hat{\rho}]\)</span> describes a dissipative process in a neat form. In the mean time, the jump operators <span class="math inline">\(\hat{L}_\mu\)</span> could also be called in many places the Lindblad operators if they yields the POVMs as defined earlier.</p>
<p>Just a note on side: the measurement operator defined earlier is usually called POVMs (postive-valued measurements) if the eigenvalues are not negative corresponding to physical projection measurement outputs. In research, finding an optimal set of measurements to retrieve the maximum information of the quantum state of a system with minimal times of measurements has been a hot topic and leads to the field of quantum tomography, compressed sensing and related algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="a-second-look-on-the-quantum-trajectories-using-stochastic-calculus-language">A second look on the quantum trajectories using stochastic calculus language</h2>
<p>Above, we have described the system-environment interaction as a process of random quantum measurements. In the cases we have studied, we treat the environmental disturb as statistically identical sources over time–to some extent, the jump probability distribution has to be identical for each jump step to be able to directly apply the pure time-differential equations we have derived earlier. Let us take a closer look on its statistic nature in the language of stochastic calculus<a href="#Gardiner1985Handbook"> [5]</a><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
For simplicity, we will stick to a given state <span class="math inline">\(\ket{\Psi(t)}\)</span>. We define a random variable–a stochastic interval <span class="math inline">\(dN_\mu(t)\)</span>–Poisson distributed with values
<div>
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dNmudistr}
dN_\mu(t) = \left\{
  \begin{array}
  \\1 , &amp; \text{with probability } p_\mu \\
  0, &amp; \text{with probability } 1-p_\mu.
  \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
</div>
It satisfies the properties based on the rule of stochastic calculus that
\begin{align}
\sum_{\mu=0}^m dN_\mu(t) &amp;=1,\label{eq:sumdNmu}\\
dN_\mu(t)dN_\nu (t) &amp;= \delta_{\mu\nu} dN_\mu(t),\\
\text{expectation value } \langle dN_\mu (t)\rangle &amp;= p_\mu = \bra{\Psi(t)} \hat{L}^\dagger_\mu \hat{L}_\mu \ket{\Psi(t)}dt.
\end{align}
Then based on the physical meaning, we can rewrite an unnormalized form of the evolved state by
\begin{align}
\ket{\tilde{\Psi}(t+dt)} &amp;= dN_0(t)\hat{M}_0\ket{\Psi(t)} + \sum_{\mu=1}^m dN_\mu (t)\hat{L}_\mu \ket{\Psi(t)}.
\end{align}
We use the property of the stochastic internal <span class="math inline">\(dN_\mu(t)\)</span> to replace <span class="math inline">\(dN_0(t)=1-\sum_{\mu=1}^m dN_\mu\)</span>, and obtain
\begin{align}
\ket{\tilde{\Psi}(t+dt)} &amp;= \hat{M}_0\ket{\Psi(t)} + \sum_{\mu=1}^m dN_\mu (t) (\hat{L}_\mu -\hat{M}_0) \ket{\Psi(t)}\\
&amp;= (\mathbb{1} - \frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}_{eff}dt)\ket{\Psi(t)} + \sum_{\mu=1}^m dN_\mu (\hat{L}_\mu - \mathbb{1} + \frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}_{eff}dt)\ket{\Psi(t)}.
\end{align}
We ignore the terms that have an order higher than <span class="math inline">\(dt\)</span> according to the rules of stochastic calculus, that is to let <span class="math inline">\(dN_\mu (t)dt \sim \sqrt{dt}dt=0\)</span>, and obtain the unnormalized state update equation
\begin{align}
d\ket{\tilde{\Psi}} &amp;\equiv \ket{\tilde{\Psi}(t+dt)} - \ket{\Psi(t)}\\
&amp;= -\frac{i}{\hbar} \hat{H}_{eff}dt\ket{\Psi} + \sum_{\mu=1}^m dN_\mu(t)(\hat{L}_\mu-1)\ket{\Psi}.
\end{align}
This is the unnormalized <strong><em>stochastic Schrodinger equation</em></strong> (SSE) for a jump update. Alternatively, in the normalized form, the SSE becomes
\begin{align}\label{eq:SSE}
d\ket{\Psi} &amp;= \left( -\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}_{eff} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\mu=1}^m \langle \hat{L}^\dagger_\mu \hat{L}_\mu \rangle \right) dt\ket{\Psi} + \sum_{\mu=1}^m dN_\mu(t) \left( \frac{\hat{L}_\mu}{\sqrt{\langle \hat{L}^\dagger_\mu \hat{L}_\mu\rangle }}-1\right)\ket{\Psi}.
\end{align}
<p>By using the definition that the density operator is the ensemble average, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\rho}(t+dt)=\bar{\ketbra{\Psi(t+dt)}{\Psi(t+dt)}}\)</span> and only keep terms up to the order of <span class="math inline">\(dt\)</span>, it is trivial to show that the Lindblad equation (Eq.<span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:lindblad}\)</span>) is equivalent to the SSE.</p>
<p>There are two important properties of the SSEs, Lindblad equations and <span class="math inline">\(dN(t)\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The SSEs and Lindblad master equations in general are unlike the normal Schrodinger equation, and could be nonlinear due to the fact that <span class="math inline">\(dN_\mu(t)\)</span> could depend on the state of <span class="math inline">\(\Psi(t)\)</span> at each time step<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</li>
<li>In our case, <span class="math inline">\(dN(t)\)</span> obeys the Poisson distribution. It means that, in every jump of the quantum trajectory, the jump statistics will be the same as the previous step, and the process of determining which trajectory to jump can be mapped to the “toss of a coin” problem–whether the result is a “head” or “tail” for every toss is predefined as independent identical instances with a uniform random distribution. This is a typical Markov chain process that the “toss of coin” doesn’t have a memory with the previous step, or physically you might want to regard this process as being jumping in steps slower than the dissipative or equilibrium process (<span class="math inline">\(\delta t \gg 1/\gamma\)</span>). Lindblad equations with a simple time-homogeneous evolution only works for Markovian processes with simple random sampling properties.</li>
</ul>
In similar cases, one can use different Lindblad operators to describe the quantum dynamics with the same form of Lindblad equations as shown in Eq.<span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:lindblad}\)</span>. Commonly, the <em>relaxation</em> process of a quantum system in presence of a reservoir can be described by the Lindblad superoperator
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}[\hat{\rho}] &amp;= -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\mu=1} \left( \hat{L}_\mu^\dagger\hat{L}_\mu\hat{\rho}+\hat{\rho}\hat{L}^\dagger_\mu\hat{L}_\mu-2\hat{L}_\mu\hat{\rho}\hat{L}^\dagger_\mu \right)\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\mu=1}\left[\hat{L}_\mu,\left[\hat{\rho}, \hat{L}_\mu \right] \right].
\end{align}
<h2 id="generalize-it-a-bit-more">Generalize it a bit more</h2>
<p>We can briefly take a look on how this formalism can be extended to other cases and find the correct Lindblad operators–yes, find a proper Lindblad operator is the only modification without changing the form of equations for some cases. For example, in a homodyne detection case<a href="#Wiseman1993Interpretation"> [6]</a>, a beam splitter is used to branch out two signal paths for the final measurement; a local oscillator, which could be a coherent laser beam locked at the same frequency as the input signal on the other branch of the beam splitter as shown in the figure below. For a balanced beam splitter, the two output branches yield the combined and subtracted signals in detection, which are the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{X}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{P}\)</span> quadratures in the phase plane.</p>
<center>
<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/homodyneheterodyne_beamsplitter.svg" alt="Fig 1. Beam splitter for homodyne and heterodyne detections." /><figcaption>Fig 1. Beam splitter for homodyne and heterodyne detections.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br> <br>
</center>
By treating the local oscillator as a coherent light with a large amplitude <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> (related to the averge phone flux with a phase factor), the input-output relationship of the beam splitter can be given by
\begin{align}
\hat{a}_\pm &amp;= \frac{\alpha\hat{\mathbb{1}} \pm \hat{a}}{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{align}
Assuming the other part of the quantum system is the same as before and the signal has <span class="math inline">\(\mu=1,\cdots,m\)</span> modes, the Lindblad operators can be written as <span class="math inline">\(\hat{J}_{\mu,\pm} = \frac{A_\mu \hat{\mathbb{1}}\pm \hat{L}_\mu}{\sqrt{2}}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(A_\mu\)</span> is a complex constant. After some algebra, the Krause operators of the homodyne case can also be defined as a linear transformation of the previous Krause operators:
\begin{align}
\left(\begin{array}{c} \hat{K}_0\\ \hat{K}_{\mu,+} \\ \hat{K}_{\mu,-}\end{array}\right)
&amp;= \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
1-\frac{1}{2}|A_\mu|^2dt &amp; 0 &amp; A_\mu \sqrt{\frac{dt}{2}}\\
A_\mu\sqrt{\frac{dt}{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1-\frac{1}{2}|A_\mu|^2dt}{\sqrt{2}}\\
A_\mu\sqrt{2} &amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1-\frac{1}{2}|A_\mu|^2dt}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{array}\right]
\left(\begin{array}{c} \hat{M}_0 \\ \hat{M}_\mu \\ 0 \end{array}\right).
\end{align}
<p>The form of Lindblad eqution and the stochastic Schrodinger equation will be the same as before<a href="#Wiseman1993Interpretation"> [6]</a>.</p>
You may ask could the sampling process have any statistical distribution types other than the uniform random distribution? Indeed, the stochastic interval <span class="math inline">\(dN_\mu(t)\)</span> can have different statistical distribution modes. In either homodyne or heterodyne measurements with a local oscillator at a frequency the same as or different from the signal merged at a beam splitter<a href="#Wiseman1993Interpretation"> [6]</a>, the local oscillator injects noise to the measurement result and affects the quantum dynamics in the process of continuous measurements. Roughly speaking, we may be able to formally rewrite the stochastic interval in the following form,
\begin{equation}
dN_\mu (t) = &lt;dN_\mu(t)&gt; + \sigma_\mu \delta W_\mu(t),
\end{equation}
<p>where the first part <span class="math inline">\(&lt;dN_\mu(t)&gt;\)</span> is the mean value of stochastic interval, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_\mu\)</span> is the variance, and <span class="math inline">\(\delta W_\mu(t)\)</span> is the Weiner stochastic variable. In our case, <span class="math inline">\(&lt;dN_\mu(t)&gt;\)</span> is proportional to the intensity of the input modes, and the variance of the signals can be determined by the square root of the photon number in the interaction time interval for a coherent light. Given a relatively strong local oscillator, the noise generated obeys the central limit law and will be a Gaussian noise. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\delta W_\mu(t)\)</span> will be a Brownian diffusion random variable in a Gaussian distribution which gives a white noise. Later, we will use <span class="math inline">\(dW(t)\)</span> to characterize the stochastic process for the normalized stochastic variable with various distribution modes. We will see the stochastic viable will eventually extend the commonly seen time-homogeneous quantum evolution to a broader spectrum of scenarios in the next part of the notes.</p>
<p>If you want to modify a quantum dynamics simulation code–either using Monte Carlo method or other algorithms–which only involves homogeneously distributed random variable to a general stochastic processes, what you need to do is to bring in a stochastic variable <span class="math inline">\(dW(t)\)</span> with other statistical distributions and find a proper integration method to solve the differential equations. Using the homodyne detection case, for instance, you can define <span class="math inline">\(dt\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dW(t)\)</span> in a time list <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> as below.</p>
<p><strong>In [1]:</strong></p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode julia"><code class="sourceCode julia">tmin = <span class="fl">0</span>.;
tmax = <span class="fl">10.0</span>;
step = <span class="fl">100</span>;
t = linspace(tmin,tmax,step);
dt = t[<span class="fl">2</span>]-t[<span class="fl">1</span>];
dW = randn(step).*dt;</code></pre></div>
<p>The variable <code>dW</code> is now a list of Gaussian/normally distributed numbers with mean <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> with the same length as <code>t</code>, and <code>dt</code> is a constant for all time steps. Easy peasy, right?</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up-for-this-part">Wrap up for this part</h2>
<p>In this part of notes, we have revisited the quantum dynamics problems that has been widely taught in undergraduate level quantum mechanics classes but in a stochastic process perspective in the end. In general, the stochastic process reflects one important nature of quantum systems and will lead to a rich church of differential equations that our JuliaQuantum libraries would want to include, and I will illustrate more on their forms in the next part. The leftover practical task for solving stochastic equations is to implementing various solvers or integrating algorithms. There are two well-known stochastic integrals–<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%C3%B4_calculus">Itô integral</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratonovich_integral">Stratonovich integral</a>. More details of the general form of stochastic differential equations and integration methods can be found in <a href="#Gardiner2004Quantum"> [7]</a> and other modern books. I will not write too much on those details, but rather give you a big picture on the connected fields.</p>
<p>On the other hand, quantum simulation packages like the <em>Quantum Optics Toolbox in Matlab</em><a href="#Tan1999Computational"> [8]</a> and its Python version <em>QuTiP</em><a href="#Johansson2013Qutip"> [9]</a> becomes widely used while the input quantities can be classified into a few object classes is mainly due to the mathematical fact that the quantum dynamics equations and quantum systems those toolboxes can simulate all have nice mathematical structures. For example, a lot of quantum dynamics problems can be described by the Lindblad form of master equations, which in the end is completely positive maps (CP-maps) and can be fully characterized by the hierarchy of complete positive operators and superoperators as mathematical objects<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. To my perspective, the existing JuliaQuantum libraries can be improved by extending its representation types to the operator and superoperator system and build more general solvers to cover the stochastic equations, and we can make better program libraries with in-depth mathematical insights and high-performance programming language. I will also touch the base of some mathematical fundation in the next part.</p>
<p>With the basic stochastic language introduced, we are ready to explore more complicated differential equations and start appreciating the nature of quantum measurements and how all of these can be connected to the quantum circuit model. I hope the following notes can help you understand those connections intuitively.</p>
