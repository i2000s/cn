        <div class="span7 offset1 post">
          <p>Twenty years ago, version 1.0 of the Conservation LAWs PACKage (CLAWPACK, now
<a href="http://clawpack.org">Clawpack</a> was first released by
<a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/">Randy LeVeque</a>.  It seems fitting to take
the occasion to look back on the intervening years.  What follows are my
thoughts on some of the great things that have resulted.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/clawpack_bday.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>As far as I can tell, 
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/na-digest-html/94/v94n44.html#5">this item in the NA-Digest</a>
is the first public announcement of its existence.
It was also announced more verbosely the same year in
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=70F5140D445F7B89AF162827E10443A7?doi=10.1.1.48.3424&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">this conference paper</a>, 
from the proceedings of the 5th HYP conference.
Reading that conference paper now, I am struck by how it incorporated many of
the ideals of scientific software development that we now discuss as if they
were new ideas.  For instance,</p>

<ul>
<li>Code that is <strong>easy to read and use</strong>, with plentiful <strong>documentation and examples</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Modular  design</strong>, that allows low-level functions to be reused
and disparate parts of the code to be modified independently.  In the case of 
Clawpack, this is epitomized by the fact that it allows the solution of <em>any</em>
system of hyperbolic PDEs by changing just a single routine (the Riemann solver).</li>
<li>An interface that allows methods and parameters to be changed easily, so that <strong>different
methods can be conveniently compared</strong>.</li>
<li>Clawpack was proposed as a <strong>benchmark</strong> against which to easily <strong>test new algorithms</strong>.</li>
<li>Clawpack was released <strong>open source</strong> and for <strong>free</strong> on a public FTP server (netlib).<br></li>
</ul>

<p>In this day of so much ado about credit for software, it&#39;s also interesting to 
view this paper as an early example of a mathematical publication that is all about software.</p>

<p>Looking through the code snippets in the paper, I was astonished to recognize how much
of the original Fortran 77 code remains virtually unaltered -- including many variable names,
function interfaces, and overall design.  This is a testament to the quality of the
original code design.</p>

<p>The central algorithms in Clawpack have also stood the test of time.  The 80&#39;s saw the
heyday of research into second-order TVD methods for conservation laws, and Clawpack
was released just as that era came to a close.  Since then, research has gone in
other directions -- high-order methods, well-balancing, and positivity preservation,
to name a few.  While these new directions have provided additions to Clawpack,
the &quot;classic&quot; algorithms have not changed and are still hard to beat as a 
robust general-purpose tool.</p>

<p>Of course, much has happened in the intervening twenty years.  The original library
handled 1- and 2-dimensional problems on regular cartesian grids.  In the next few years,
subsequent versions added algorithms for
<a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/pubs/wp3d/index.html">3D</a>, mapped grids, and
<a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/pubs/amrclaw/index.html">adaptively refined meshes</a>.</p>

<p>Additional algorithmic innovations are too numerous to try to list, but one
that has had a lot of impact is <a href="http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S106482750139738X">the f-wave technique</a>.</p>

<p>The problems to which Clawpack has been applied are certainly <strong>much</strong> too numerous to list.
But you can start to get an idea by looking at citations of major Clawpack papers like
<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=17725852758276924945&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en">this</a>,
<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=7413565796955546825&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en">this</a>,
<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=13042879341964900053&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en">this</a>,
<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=13610946858631858859&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en">this</a>,
and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=7380133178147045066&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en">this</a>.
Perhaps the heaviest use in recent years has involved geophysical flows such as tsunamis and
storm surges, in GeoClaw.</p>

<h2>The Clawpack family of codes</h2>

<p>Clawpack has spawned numerous offshoots and extensions, including (but not limited to)
<a href="http://www.clawpack.org/amrclaw.html">AMRClaw</a>, 
<a href="http://mitran-lab.amath.unc.edu:8084/redmine/projects/bearclaw/wiki">BearClaw</a>, 
<a href="http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?121287">ZPLClaw</a>, 
<a href="http://www.clawpack.org/doc/pyclaw/solvers.html?highlight=sharpclaw#pyclaw.sharpclaw.solver.SharpClawSolver">SharpClaw</a>, 
<a href="https://scholarworks.aub.edu.lb/handle/10938/9322">CUDAClaw</a>,
<a href="http://math.boisestate.edu/%7Ecalhoun/ForestClaw/">ForestClaw</a>, 
<a href="https://github.com/manyclaw/manyclaw">ManyClaw</a>,
<a href="http://www.clawpack.org/pyclaw/index.html">PyClaw</a>,
and <a href="http://www.clawpack.org/geoclaw.html">GeoClaw</a>.
Some of these have become part of the Clawpack-5 suite while others
have forked and gone in other directions.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the term Clawpack refers to a collection of interrelated packages 
that are maintained and developed at <a href="http://github.com/clawpack">github.com/clawpack</a>.
They include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The original (&quot;Classic&quot;) Clawpack;</li>
<li>AMRClaw (with adaptive mesh refinement)</li>
<li>GeoClaw (with special tools for geophysical flows)</li>
<li>PyClaw (a Python interface to both the classic code and the high-order &quot;SharpClaw&quot; algorithms)</li>
<li>Riemann (a library of approximate Riemann solvers, which can be used with all of the above codes)</li>
<li>VisClaw (an in-house visualization tool)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Github organization also includes repositories for the docs and for contributed
applications.</p>

<h2>The Clawpack community</h2>

<p>As far as I know, the original release was a one-person effort.  But like
most open-source projects, Clawpack quickly became a broader collaboration.
I won&#39;t attempt to credit everyone here; you can see some of the major contributors
<a href="http://www.clawpack.org/about.html#authors">here</a>, and many more by looking
at the contributors pages on Github.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/HPC3-2012-group-photo.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I was surprised to realize that I&#39;ve now been involved with Clawpack for
half of its existence -- ten years!  During those years I&#39;ve gotten to work
with an group of exceptional researchers who are also just outstanding people.
They say that the culture of an open-source software community is shaped strongly
by its founder, and I think Clawpack is no exception.<br>
It seems to me that its creator is not only a great applied mathematician, but
also somene who consistently leads the way in terms of improving the way we do
science.  Clawpack exemplifies his commitment to reproducibility and sustainable
scientific software development, long before those words came into scientific
vogue.  He was an advocate for publishing in journals with low subscription
prices, long before open access became a movement.<br>
Most significantly, he has always been interested first in finding and solving
interesting problems, and only secondarily in publishing papers.
Both through his personal influence and as chair of the SIAM Journals Committee,
he has been influential in making progress in these directions, including the
establishment of a Software section in SISC, the acceptance by SIAM journals
of supplementary materials (including code), and a new policy allowing authors
to post published articles on their own or institutional websites.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/hpc3_attendees.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>As a result, the culture surrounding Clawpack has always encouraged openness
and a willingness to accept new contributions.  Furthermore, I think that the
Clawpack developers have maintained a healthy skepticism toward our own
algorithms and code.  Although we try to make our code useful to as many people
as possible, there has never been any attempt to evangelize the community in
order to increase use of a particular set of algorithms or to increase
metrics like citation counts.  Because of this attitude, the code is
continually improved through incorporation of new algorithmic innovations.</p>

<h2>Lessons learned</h2>

<p>Of course, it would be wrong to say that Clawpack has been a perfect model
for scientific code development.  There are plenty of things we&#39;ve done
wrong or could learn to improve.  </p>

<p>The original announcement says that
&quot;contributions from other users will be gratefully accepted,&quot;
and that has always been true.  Nevertheless, the widely accepted development
model for a long time was that most users would take the code, fork it,
and make their own enhancements that would never get back to the main codebase.
While this prevented feature bloat, it also meant that a great wealth of
knowledge -- largely in the form of sophisticated approximate Riemann solvers
-- will perish on some dusty hard drive
rather than benefitting the larger community.  We&#39;re trying to change
that now by encouraging users to submit pull requests for Riemann
solvers and for entire applications.</p>

<p>Another example of where I see room for improvement is in output and visualization,
where we have, to some degree, reinvented the wheel.  Clawpack has long used
custom ASCII and binary file formats, that can only be read in by Clawpack
(or by reverse-engineering code for the relatively simple formats).
We are now pushing to move to a more standard default format (probably HDF5),
which would allow easier integration with standard visualization and post-processing
libraries.  </p>

<p>On the visualization side, the Clawpack developers have created
some extremely useful tools for plotting time-dependent data on structured grids
(including block-structured AMR).  These tools sit on top of MATLAB and matplotlib.
A large amount of work has gone into these &quot;in-house&quot; tools rather than into
leveraging and contributing to dedicated visualization tools.  Meanwhile, individual
users have occasionally connected Clawpack to powerful visualization tools, but
their custom code never got back to the main codebase.  The limited capabilities
of matplotlib in 3D seem to finally be providing sufficient impetus to force us
to integrate with a sophisticated visualization library.  I have been working lately
on integration with <a href="http://yt-project.org">yt</a>.</p>

<h2>The next 20 years?</h2>

<p>It may come as a surprise for a code that&#39;s so long in the tooth, but I think
Clawpack development at present is more vibrant than
ever.  Since 2011, we&#39;ve held annual developer workshops, the latest
of which took place last week here at KAUST.  The pictures on this page
are from those workshops (the cake in the first photo, which shows the Clawpack
logo, was made by my wife, and is a fondant version of a fluid-dynamical
shockwave hitting a low-density bubble).</p>

<p>As for the future, I won&#39;t claim enough clairvoyance to see 20 years ahead.
But here are some things I hope we can accomplish in the next few years:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Massively parallel adaptive mesh refinement</strong> (at present, it exists only in
the unreleased ForestClaw code; a concurrent effort is bring this to PyClaw
through BoxLib);</li>
<li>An ever-growing <strong>library of Riemann solvers</strong> for increasingly complex systems;</li>
<li><strong>Code-generation</strong> for solving problems where a custom Riemann solver is not yet available;</li>
<li>Incorporation of code that runs on <strong>accelerators</strong> (like CUDAClaw and ManyClaw)
into the main library in a way that allows users to change hardware seamlessly;</li>
<li>More <strong>teaching tools</strong> based on Clawpack and IPython notebooks, including a
book showcasing Riemann solutions of important physical systems;</li>
<li><strong>Additional algorithms</strong> (such as Discontinuous Galerkin methods and new time
stepping techniques) that can be accessed through the same problem setup and use the
same Riemann solvers;</li>
<li>Better <strong>interoperability</strong> between Clawpack and other codes (such as 
<a href="http://proteus.usace.army.mil/">Proteus</a>), by making Clawpack more of a true
library.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are you excited yet?  I certainly am.  Come join the fun!</p>
